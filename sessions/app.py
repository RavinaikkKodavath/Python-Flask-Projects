# Flask Session â€“
# Flask-Session is an extension for Flask that supports Server-side Session to your application.
# The Session is the time between the client logs in to the server and logs out of the server.
# The data that is required to be saved in the Session is stored in a temporary directory on the server.
# The data in the Session is stored on the top of cookies and signed by the server cryptographically.
# Each client will have their own session where their own data will be stored in their session.
# Uses of Session
# Remember each user when they log in
# Store User-specific website settings (theme)
# Store E-Commerce site user items in the cart
